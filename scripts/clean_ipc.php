/**
 * PHP Simple Daemon IPC Cleaner
 * @author Shane Harter

 *
 * When developing a daemon that uses Workers, it's common that crashes and kill -9's leave certain
 * kernel-level interprocess communication (IPC) resources unreleased. This script will release all allocated shared
 * memory segments, message queues, and semaphores.
 *
 * You should not run this on a production server unless you know what you're doing. Doing so could interfere with other
 * applications, servers and daemons that may be running on the system.
 *
 * If you do need to clean up IPC resources in a more selective way, on linux you can use the ipcs and ipcrm commands.
 * Running `ipcs` will show you information about each memory segment, queue and semaphore. You can then pass the ID
 * displayed there in column 2 to ipcrm, which is what we're doing in this script.
 *
 * You have to pass iprcm a flag indicating the type of resources (-m, -q, and -s for Shared Memory, Queues and Semaphores, respectively), and then the ID.
 *
 * Note:
 * If your system does not have `ipcs` or `ipcrm` binaries, install the linux-util-ng package
