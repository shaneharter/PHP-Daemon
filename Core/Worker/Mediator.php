/**
 * Create and run worker processes.
 * Use message queues and shared memory to coordinate worker processes and return work product to the daemon.
 * Uses system v message queues because afaik there's no existing PHP implementation of posix	queues.
 *
 * At a high level, workers are implemented using a Mediator pattern. When a worker is created (by passing a Callable or
 * an instance of Core_IWorker to the Core_Daemon::worker() method) the Daemon creates a Mediator instance and
 * passes-in the worker.
 *
 * When worker methods are called the Daemon is actually interacting with the Mediator instance. Calls are serialized in
 * a very simple proprietary serialization format (to avoid any additional dependencies) and dispatched to worker processes.
 * The Mediator is responsible for keeping worker processes running, mediating calls and returns, and enforcing timeouts on jobs.
 *
 * The daemon does have the option of disintermediating work by calling methods directly on the worker object. If a worker
 * alias was Acme, a disintermediated call to doSomething() from the Daemon execute() method would look like:
 * @example $this->Acme->inline()->doSomething();	 // Call doSomething() in-process (blocking)
 *
 * And if Acme was a Function worker it would work in a similar way:
 * @example $this->Acme->inline();
 *
 *
 * @todo Improve the dump() feature to include data-driven advice about the suggested memory allocation
 *			 and number of workers. It's very hard for a novice to have any feeling for those things and they are vital to
 *			 having a worker that runs flawlessly.
